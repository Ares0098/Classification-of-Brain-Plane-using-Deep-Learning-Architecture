# Classification-of-Brain-Plane-using-Deep-Learning-Architecture
This project aims to compare the 'epoch' parameter for brain plane classification cases using the deep learning architecture VGG16, which consists of three labels: Transthalamic, Trans-cerebellum and Trans-Ventricular.

## Dataset
The dataset can be accessed at this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jEGcEyb2FAe6f7AszvDGRu76uQXTWRmi?usp=sharing

The dataset is divided into two parts, train and test (Request for access is required).

## Directory
The directories in the notebook file are adjusted according to the needs.

## Output project
